# Project Euler 066 - Diophantine Equation

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form x<sup>2</sup> - Dy<sup>2</sup> = 1.

For example, when D = 13, the minimal solution in x is 649<sup>2</sup> - 13 x 180<sup>2</sup> = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:

3<sup>2</sup> - 2x2<sup>2</sup> = 1, 2<sup>2</sup> - 3x1<sup>2</sup> = 1, 
9<sup>2</sup> - 5x4<sup>2</sup> = 1, 5<sup>2</sup> - 6x2<sup>2</sup> = 1,
8<sup>2</sup> - 7x3<sup>2</sup> = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D &le; 7, the largest x is obtained when D = 5.

Find the value of D &le; 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.
